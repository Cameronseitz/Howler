# Howler
This is a CSC 342 personal project to imitate a social media website. It is client-side rendered using javascript, 
communicates with the backend using REST API, and stores its data in json files. Howler lets users post a "howl" for
whatever is on their mind. It also lets users follow and unfollow others as well as see what they have "howled." 
Authentication is handled using a custom implementation of JWT, which shows the underlyings of how they work cryptographically.

## How to Run
1. Final Project folder and use Docker:
`docker-compose up --build`
2. The page will be available on localhost at port 80.
